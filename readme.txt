2. Track any other application stat in your WordPress site with 1 line of code in your plugin/theme.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
By default the parent namespace used for stats is "yourdomain_yourpath.wordpress.*" where yourdomain_yourpath would be "www_domain_com_blog" if your site is http://www.domain.com/blog/. You can override the parent namespace via the `define('STATSD_NAMESPACE', 'mysite.myserver');` define in wp-config.php. This one is very important, controls how it shows up in Graphite stats.
This should be segmented, left to right general to specific. All "." trigger segments. For example:
applicationname.server like 'wpmudev.app1' or 'edublogs.web4'. That allows for drilling down, but can still wrapup in graphs with 'edublogs.*' etc.

Can also be run as an mu-plugin by dropping statsd.php in `/wp-content/mu-plugins/`.

If needed you can overide the default UDP port of 8125 via `define('STATSD_PORT', xxxx);` define.

If you have a very high traffic site you can lower the default 0.5 sample rate for per-pageload calls via `STATSD_SAMPLE_RATE`.
